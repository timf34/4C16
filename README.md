# 4C16 

### Workflow 

**Downloading the labs**
- Open `Copy of 4c16-git-workflow.ipynb` in `4thYear/4C16` in Google Drive 
    - Enter the lab number and run the cells. 

**Working on the labs**
- Copy the lab files from `4c16-labs/code` (_this is a different folder to `4thYear`_) to Pycharm in the `4c16` project 
- Work on them locally

**Push**
- Drag and drop the files back into the lab folder in `4c16-labs/code`
- Run the "Commit and Push" and "Push to Server" cells (in `...git-workflow...`) :relaxed:
